In the Cesbo Alta system, the HTTP server configuration allows you to manage server settings for application management and for OTT streaming. The following parameters are customizable:

![HTTP Server Options](https://cdn.cesbo.com/help/alta/admin-guide/settings/http-server/server.png)

- **Interface**:
    - **Any**: Accepts connections from all available network interfaces.
    - **Localhost**: Limits connections to the local machine only.
- **Port**: You can select any available (unused) port number. By default, the following ports are configured during the `alta init` process:
    - **Management Port**: Used for the web interface and API access.
    - **OTT Port**: Dedicated for streaming access to channels.

## HTTPS

- **Certificate**: Full path to the SSL/TLS certificate chain that secures HTTPS connections. For example, `/etc/dehydrated/certs/example.com/fullchain.pem`.
- **Private Key**: Full path to the corresponding private key for the certificate. For example, `/etc/dehydrated/certs/example.com/privkey.pem`.

You can obtain a free TLS certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) using tools like Dehydrated. For more information, consult the guide on setting up HTTPS certificates.

## Server Headers

- **Server Tokens**: This is the HTTP `Server` header. By default, it contains the server name and version, such as `Alta/version-number`. You can choose to reveal or obscure this information based on security preferences.
- **Allow Origin**: Control which domains can access your server by adding trusted domains for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) through the **Add** button.

## Timeouts & Limits

- **Read (Sec)**: Set to **2 seconds** to limit the time for reading data from clients.
- **Write (Sec)**: Configurable to **10 seconds** for sending data.
- **Idle (Sec)**: Set to **10 seconds** to disconnect inactive connections.
- **Limit**: The default value is **5000**, allowing up to 5000 concurrent connections.

These configurations provide flexibility and security for setting up your OTT server, ensuring optimal performance and compatibility for streaming applications.

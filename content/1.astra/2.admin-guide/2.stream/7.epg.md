![Stream EPG Export Options](https://cdn.cesbo.com/help/astra/admin-guide/stream/epg.png)

- **XMLTV Channel ID** - use a custom channel ID instead of primary ID
- **Format** - EPG Export format:
    - **XMLTV** - this is popular format is used for storing and distributing EPG. XMLTV is compatible with various middleware and IPTV players
    - **JSON** - useful for sending EPG to external servers or for direct use in a web application. For instance, it can be embedded on a website
- **Destination** - destination for EPG Export:
    - **file://** - save the EPG to a local file. For example, using `file:///tmp/test_channel.xml` will store the EPG in the `/tmp` directory with the filename `test_channel.xml`
    - **http://** - sending EPG using an HTTP POST request. On the server side, an application is required to handle the received request, such as EPG Aggregator
- **Codepage** - decode text from received EIT packets using defined codepage. Stored text is always encoded with UTF-8

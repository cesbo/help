## Addresses

IP Authorization supports IPv4 and IPv6 addresses with CIDR notation.

## Example

- `allow 127.0.0.1` - allow request from localhost
- `deny 192.168.0.100` - deny access to single address
- `pass 192.168.0.0/24` - pass client from the IPv4 network to the next authorizer - securetoken or backend
- `pass fd32:ce04:8a5c::1/64` - same for IPv6 network
- `deny any` - deny access for any other addresses

DVB-S/S2 is a standard for Satellite Television

## General options

![DVB-S/S2 General Options](https://storage.crisp.chat/users/helpdesk/website/ba41e739dc7e3800/dvb-s-general_1wlt6m1.png)

- **Frequency** - carrier frequency (950-13250 MHz)
- **Polarization** - signal polarization. For linear polarization: Vertical, Horizontal. For circular polarization: Right, Left
- **Symbolrate** - symbol rate also known as the baud rate, refers to the number of signal changes per second (1000-50000 Kbaud)

## LNB (Low-Noise Block) options

![LNB Options](https://storage.crisp.chat/users/helpdesk/website/ba41e739dc7e3800/dvb-s-lnb_12t32zn.png)

- **LOF1** - Low sub-band, MHz
- **LOF2** - High sub-band, MHz
- **SLOF** - Sub-band range. If adapter frequency more than SLOF, than will be used LOF2 value and sends tone (22 kHz) signal to LNB to switch
- **Force Tone** - option to send 22 KHz tone signal
- **LNB Mode** - select additional LNB modes

Default options depends on the adapter frequency:

| Frequency range | LOF1 | LOF2 | SLOF |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10700 .. 13250 | 9750 | 10600 | 11700 |
| 4500 .. 4800 | 5950 | 0 | 0 |
| 3400 .. 4200 | 5150 | 0 | 0 |
| 2500 .. 2700 | 3650 | 0 | 0 |
| 950 .. 2150 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

::alert
For circular polarized converters (e.g. 36°E, 56°E), set 10750 in LOF1
::

## LNB Polarization

The LNB polarization option controls the signal received by the satellite dish. The voltage level for LNB power supply is defined by the polarization:

- 13V is for Vertical/Right polarization. Switching signal in the range of 11-14 Volts
- 18V is for Horizontal/Left polarization. Switching signal in the range of 16-20 Volts

## LNB Modes

- **LNB Sharing** - in this mode, the LNB voltage supply and tone signal are disabled. This allows you to connect several DVB-adapters to a single converter through a passive splitter. On the splitter, only one adapter must be active; the any other adapters should be passive. All adapters on the same splitter should use the same polarization and the same sub-band (frequency greater or less than the value of slof)
- **DiSEqC 1.0** - digital Satellite Equipment Control is a communication protocol for use between a satellite receiver and a device such as a multi-dish switch or a small dish antenna rotor. Version 1.0 allows switching between up to 4 satellite sources
- **DiSEqC 1.1** - allows switching between up to 16 satellite sources
- **DiSEqC Command** - sends a raw command to DiSEqC
- **Tone Burst** - also known as mini DiSEqC. Allows switching between 2 satellite sources
- **Unicable I (EN50494)** - provides simultaneous access to multiple LNBs over a single coaxial cable for several receivers. Version I provides access up to 8 satellite sources
- **Unicable II (EN50607)** - provides access to up to 32 satellite sources

## Advanced options

![DVB-S/S2 Advanced Options](https://storage.crisp.chat/users/helpdesk/website/ba41e739dc7e3800/dvb-s-advanced_7d3gqh.png)

- **Modulation** - method used to convert digital data into an analog signal. Default: QPSK for DVB-S, PSK8 for DVB-S2
- **FEC** - forward error correction. Default: Auto
- **Roll-Off** - spectrum efficiency. Only for DVB-S2. Default: 35
- **Stream ID** - PLP stream ID for multistream transponders. Only for DVB-S2

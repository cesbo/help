## Channel Logo

By adding logos to your channel playlists, you provide your viewers with a more visually appealing and user-friendly experience. Logos help users quickly identify their favorite channels and make browsing through the playlist more efficient.

With the "Path to TV logos" option, you can specify the location of the images directory on your server. Astra loads images with the same name as the channel name and appends the logo to the playlist information.

1. Create a directory: `/var/lib/astra/tvg-logo`
2. In the **Path to TV logos**, set the full path to this directory: `/var/lib/astra/tvg-logo`
3. Save channel logos to the directory. Use the same file name as the channel name. For example: `Travel Channel.png`

## Export DVB list to the file

When Astra starts up, it retrieves information about the DVB adapters installed on the system. In some rare cases, this operation can take a long time. To prevent Astra from updating this information on each start, you can save it to a file.

To do this, follow these steps:

Create directory for Astra scripts:

```
mkdir -p /etc/astra/mod
```

Export the DVB list to a Lua file:

```
astra --dvbls -o /etc/astra/mod/dvb.lua
```

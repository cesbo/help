At our company, we offer support free of charge for quick questions related to sales, as well as assistance with first-time installation and issues with our website. However, technical support is only provided to customers who have purchased a Subscription or Lifetime license.

We strive to respond to all support requests as quickly as possible, though we don't currently offer priority support. Rest assured that we will reply to your request as soon as we can.

In order to help us prioritize your request, we have a set of guidelines that we follow:

- The highest priority have issues related to bugs in our software;
- Issues with the environment in which our software operates, such as channels for receiving and processing data, hardware, and network issues;
- Features requests;
- Maintenance tasks such as installation, configuration and updating.

We hope this information is helpful and enables us to provide you with the best possible support. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Password could be changed by administrator. There are two ways to do it: web interface and console wizard.

## Web Interface

Administrator can change password for any user by going to Settings > Users, then selecting the user's account and clicking on the action menu to choose the 'Reset Password':

## Console Wizard

You may use console wizard to reset own password. On your server launch next command:

```
alta reset-password
```

Wizard ask you next details:

- Service Name
- User login
- New password. Please note that password is not showing in the console on typing

## Troubleshooting

If you have any issues with console wizard please check common errors:

### Service not found

Service is not started or installed on another server

### Permission denied

Service is more privileged than wizard. Launch command with sudo to raise privileges:

```
sudo alta reset-password
```

### User not found

User with defined name is not found

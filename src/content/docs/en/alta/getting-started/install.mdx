## Install Alta

<Steps>

1. **Open your server console and download binary file**

    ```sh
    curl -Lo /usr/bin/alta https://cesbo.com/alta-latest
    ```

2. **Set execute permission**

    ```sh
    chmod +x /usr/bin/alta
    ```

3. **Installation completed**

    You can check the installed version of Alta by running:

    ```sh
    alta version
    ```

</Steps>

## Start service

The initialization wizard prepares a new service on your system. Each service has its own configuration file, management port, and unique name. Launch the initialization wizard with this command:

```sh
alta init
```

- **Service name**: Unique identifier for the service.
- **Config path**: Full path to config file; directories created as needed.
- **Admin login**: Username for first admin.
- **Admin password**: Set and confirm password (not visible while typing).
- **Management port**: API/Web UI port (e.g., `127.0.0.1:8100`).
- **OTT Port**: OTT Streaming Port (e.g., `127.0.0.1:8200`)
- **Add to systemd**: Registers the service for system management.
- **Launch on startup**: Enable if added to systemd.
- **Start service**: Launch immediately.

You can run multiple services using unique service names and ports. Read more: [Manage Alta Services](/en/alta/admin-guide/manage-services)

## Access Web Interface

Your service is ready to use. Connect to the Web Interface using any web browser. If you kept the default port `8100`, the interface address will be `http://server-address:8100` where server-address is your server IP or hostname.
To log in, use the username `admin` and the password you defined in the wizard.

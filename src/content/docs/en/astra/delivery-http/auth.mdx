HTTP authorization controls who can access your protected video content. It ensures only authorized users can watch your streams.

## Authorization workflow

Before configuring authorization in Astra, you need to understand how the process works.

<Steps>

1. **Get channel list from Middleware**

    ![List of TV channels](https://cdn.cesbo.com/help/astra/delivery/http-hls/auth/step-1.svg)

    The client sends their login credentials to your Middleware system. If the credentials are valid, the Middleware returns a list of channels the user can access. Each channel includes a unique token for later authorization.

2. **Request channel from Astra**

    ![Request Channel](https://cdn.cesbo.com/help/astra/delivery/http-hls/auth/step-2.svg)

    When the user selects a channel, their video player sends a request to Astra with the unique token from Step 1.

3. **Astra authorizes the request**

    Astra checks the token against the configured authorization method. If the token is valid, Astra returns the channel stream. If not, it responds with an error.

## Authorization methods

- **[User Authorization](/en/astra/delivery-http/auth-user/)** - Uses login/password or tokens stored in Astra's user settings
- **[HTTP Backend Authorization](/en/astra/delivery-http/auth-backend/)** - Sends the token to your Middleware for verification
- **[Securetoken](/en/astra/delivery-http/auth-securetoken/)** - Validates tokens using cryptographic algorithms
- **[IP Authorization](/en/astra/delivery-http/auth-ip/)** - Checks if the user's IP address is on your access list

Choose the method that best fits your security needs and existing infrastructure.

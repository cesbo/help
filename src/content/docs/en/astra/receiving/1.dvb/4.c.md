- `Modulation` - method used to convert digital data into an analog signal that can be transmitted over the cable network. In DVB-C, the most commonly used modulation schemes are 64-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)
- `FEC` - forward error correction is a technique used to reduce errors in the transmission of digital data. In DVB-C, FEC is typically specified using a ratio of the number of redundant bits to the total number of transmitted bits

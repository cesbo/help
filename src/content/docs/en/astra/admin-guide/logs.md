The log messages in Astra provide insight into the service status and activities during the receiving and processing of data streams. Log messages are categorized into several types:

- `errors` - indicate operational issues that can disrupt the stream input
- `warnings` - point out issues with the disrupted stream or those that might not affect streams at all
- `information` - includes limited number of messages, such as version information on process start, normal exit, process restart, activation input on the stream, and a few others
- `debug` - detailed information about receiving and processing activities. Turned off by default and can be enabled in the log settings or using command line argument `--debug`
- `access log` - this kind off messages records requests to the built-in Astra HTTP server. The access logs are separate from other logs and stored in a specific file. For more detals, please refer to the [Access Log](/en/astra/logs/access-log/)

## Web interface

Log could be found in web interface, just click "Log" in the main menu:

![Logs in web interface](https://cdn.cesbo.com/help/astra/admin-guide/log/web.png)

- `Search` - search bar in the main menu could be used to filter messages
- `Settings` - basic log options
- `Clear` - clear log in the web interface. On the server Astra keep log as is

![Log settings](https://cdn.cesbo.com/help/astra/admin-guide/log/web-settings.png)

- `API Access` - write to the log all API requests to Astra. Useful to check who manage your service
- `Debug` - write detalied information about receiving and processing

## Console

By default, Astra writes all information to the file `/var/log/astra.log`. File name depends of the service name. Therefore, if you have launched several instances on the same server, the file name will be same as a service name.


## HTTP Access Logs

HTTP Access Logs is an information about processed requests by the buil-in Astra HTTP server. HTTP Access Logs disabled by default, you may turn it on in the Settings â†’ General, set full path to the log file in the "HTTP Access Log" field. For example: `/var/log/astra-access.log`

### Log Fields

```
192.168.88.100 - - [11/Aug/2023:07:03:07 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 0
192.168.88.100 - admin [11/Aug/2023:07:03:07 +0000] "POST /control/ HTTP/1.1" 200 0
198.51.100.1 - - [11/Aug/2023:07:03:08 +0000] "GET /play/a0g2/71545838.m3u8 HTTP/1.1" 200 0
198.51.100.1 - - [11/Aug/2023:07:03:08 +0000] "GET /play/a0g2/113900585_92b9.ts HTTP/1.1" 200 0
```

Access log has format like most HTTP servers:

```
remote_addr - remote_user [time] "request" status bytes_sent
```

## Log Rotation

Logrotate is a system utility that manages the automatic rotation and compression of log files.

:::caution
Please use log rotation to save disk space and ensure your logs remain in good condition
:::

By default, Astra rotates its own log file, but does not rotate the HTTP Access Log. To set up log rotation for the HTTP Access Log using logrotate, create a new configuration file at `/etc/logrotate.d/astra`:

```
/var/log/astra-access.log {
    daily
    rotate 10
    missingok
    notifempty
    compress
    delaycompress
    sharedscripts
    postrotate
        systemctl reload astra || true
    endscript
}
```

- `/var/log/astra-access.log` - full path to the log file. You can define multiple files separated by spaces
- `daily` - daily rotation. Each log archive file will contain records for a single day
- `rotate 10` - only the last 10 log archive files are kept. For daily rotation, this equates to 10 days of archives
- `missingok` - ignore error if defined log file is not found
- `notifempty` - log will not be rotated if it is empty
- `compress` - compress the log archive files with gzip
- `delaycompress` - new log archive file will be compressed on the next day. As Astra continues to write logs to the new log archive file until the `postrotate` script runs, this option needed to prevent the loss of the latest messages
- `sharedscripts` - execute the `postrotate` script once for all log files
- `postrotate` - command is executed after log file is rotated. Astra receives a signal to start writing in the new empty file

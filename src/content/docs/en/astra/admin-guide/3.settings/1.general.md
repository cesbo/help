General Settings in Astra encompass a collection of essential configuration options that allow you to customize and optimize your software setup.  These settings ensure a seamless streaming experience by managing aspects like InfluxDB integration, HTTP Server Settings, and Default Stream Options.

## InfluxDB Integration

The InfluxDB integration options in Astra allow you to configure the connection between Astra and InfluxDB for storing statistics related to streams and adapters.

- `Instance Name` - data store name. As a default Astra used the InfluxDB
- `InfluxDB Address` - attached storage address. As a default address of the InfluxDB is: `http://db-server:8086`
- `InfluxDB Organization` - name of your orgranization in the InfluxDB settings
- `InfluxDB Token` - if you need to connect an external interface, then you need to enter API token from clipboard

For a detailed guide, please refer to [Integration Astra with InfluxDB](../../monitoring/export/influxdb)

## Monitoring

The Monitoring feature in Astra is a legacy option that enables sending event data, such as stream and adapter statistics, through HTTP POST requests to external services.

## HTTP Server Options

The HTTP Server Options in Astra allow you to configure the HTTP Server for providing access to media content using HTTP MPEG-TS or HLS protocols.

- `HTTP Access Log` - full path to the file for writing the request log
- `HTTP Sessions` - enables HTTP Sessions to authenticate and track user activity. When enabled, the "Sessions" item appears in the main menu to view all active sessions. Options enabled by default
- `Sessions Backend Address` - webhook to export information about sessions on finalization
- `Minimal Session Time` - send webhook information about sessions lasting longer than the minimal time.

To enable HTTPS, configure the following options:

- `TLS certificate chain` - full path to the certificate chain. For example: `/etc/dehydrated/certs/example.com/fullchain.pem`
- `TLS certificate key` - full path to the certificate key. For example - `/etc/dehydrated/certs/example.com/privkey.pem`
- `Disable TLS on primary port` - check this option if you want the primary port, defined by the command-line argument `-p PORT`, to work without HTTPS

You can obtain a free certificate from Let's Encrypt. For a detailed guide, please refer to [HTTPS certificate with Dehydrated](../../../misc/tools-and-utilities/network/dehydrated)

## Default stream options

These settings are global for all streams (unless overridden in the stream settings)

- `Start stream on demand` - activate streams in the presence of HTTP clients. Enabled by default
- `HTTP Keep Active` - defines time in seconds, during which the stream will be active, despite the absence of clients. By the default is 0 - turns channel off immediately when last client closed session
- `Backup Start Delay` - sets delay in seconds before switching to a backup source
- `Backup Return Delay` - sets delay in seconds before returning to the previous source
- `Default codepage` - define codepage for stream information in SDT
- `Service provider` - your company name. Used in the SDT stream description
- `Network name` - name of the provider's network. Used in the SDT stream description
- `TCP Congestion Control` - defines the operation algorithm for TCP CC
- `CC Limit` - sets limit on the number of CC errors in the source. After exceeding this limit - the source will be considered non-working
- `Use multithreading for UDP receiving and transmitting` - launch separate threads for processing UDP sockets, turned on by the default
- `Bind DVB adapters by MAC` - use DVB MAC addresses to bind configured adapters to the system device

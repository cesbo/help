Configure the redundancy behaviour to automatically switch stream inputs in case of a failure.

![Stream Backup Options](https://cdn.cesbo.com/help/astra/admin-guide/stream/backup.png)

- `Backup Type` - redundancy behaviour type. Default: Active Backup
- `Initial Delay` - delay in seconds before starting the next input after the stream has been initiated. Default: 5 for UDP or SRT; 10 for HLS, HTTP MPEG-TS, or RTSP; 120 for DVB
- `Start Delay` - delay in seconds before starting the next input. Default: 5
- `Return Delay` - delay for Active Backup in seconds for returning to the previous input

The integrated analyzer continuously monitors the active input, and if a fault is detected, it immediately switches to an alternate input.

## Active Backup

The default behavior is Active Backup. In the event of a failure, Astra switches to the next input while continuing to analyze the previous inputs for a potential switch back.

If all inputs fail, Astra will continue to stream latest avilable input. To halt streaming, an additional option is available for the Backup Type: "Active Backup and Stop streaming if all inputs are inactive"

## Passive Backup

In the event of a failure, Astra switches to the next input and stops the previous input. If the last input fails, Astra will automatically switch back to the first input

## Disabled Backup

In the event of a failure, Astra does nothing. This method is suitable for manually switching inputs using the Web Interface or API methods.

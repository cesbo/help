Configure the EPG Export to extract Electronic Programme Guide from stream

![Stream EPG Export Options](https://cdn.cesbo.com/help/astra/admin-guide/stream/epg.png)

- `XMLTV Channel ID` - use a custom channel ID instead of primary ID
- `Format` - EPG Export format:
    - `XMLTV` - this is popular format is used for storing and distributing EPG. XMLTV is compatible with various middleware and IPTV players
    - `JSON` - useful for sending EPG to external servers or for direct use in a web application. For instance, it can be embedded on a website
- `Destination` - destination for EPG Export:
    - `file://` - save the EPG to a local file. For example, using `file:///tmp/test_channel.xml` will store the EPG in the `/tmp` directory with the filename `test_channel.xml`
    - `http://` - sending EPG using an HTTP POST request. On the server side, an application is required to handle the received request, such as EPG Aggregator
- `Codepage` - decode text from received EIT packets using defined codepage. Stored text is always encoded with UTF-8

## EPG Aggregator

EPG Aggregator is a script for Astra to receive EPG from many servers and save it into the single XMLTV file.

### Install

To install script, download it and save on the server. You may do that with `curl` command on the server:

```sh
curl -Lo /etc/astra/epg-aggregator.lua https://cdn.cesbo.com/astra/scripts/epg-aggregator/epg-aggregator.lua
```

### Start script with Systemd

To start script automatically you may append it to the systemd.

1. Download configuration file: https://cdn.cesbo.com/astra/scripts/epg-aggregator/astra-epg.service
2. In this file you may configure command line arguments
3. Save file on your server to `/etc/systemd/system/astra-epg.service`
4. Start script: `systemctl start astra-epg`
5. Enable autorun: `systemctl enable astra-epg`

Command line arguments:

- `-o /tmp/epg.xml` - full path to store generated XMLTV file
- `-p 5000` -port for receiving requests from Astra
- `–daemon` - run as daemon
- `–interval SEC` - interval of saving EPG to file. default: 60 seconds
- `–stalker` — replace tag `<sub-title>` to `<desc>` for middleware Stalker/Ministra

Script is ready to receive requests from Astra

### Configure Astra for EPG Aggregator

In stream settings, on the "EPG" tab, configure the EPG Export:

- `Format` - set `JSON`
- `Destination` - set `http://EPG_agregator_IP:5000`

XMLTV file with the collected data will be located on the path: `/tmp/epg.xml`.
Also you may download XMLTV from http://EPG_agregator_IP:5000/epg.xml or you may append this URL to the client application.

### Restart EPG Aggregator nightly

In some cases you may need to restart EPG Aggregator, better to do that nightly.
You may do that with a system scheduler - cron. Open cron configuration:

```
sudo crontab -e
```

and append line to the file:

```
0 4 * * * systemctl restart astra-epg
```

Save changes in cron. Collector will restart each night at 4:00

With Astra, you can receive MPTS (Multi Program Transport Stream) from different sources, including UDP. The received MPTS can be demultiplexed into several SPTS (Single Program Transport Stream) channels.

## Virtual Adapter

For quick and simple configuration of MPTS reception, you may use the Virtual Adapter. Click on "New Adapter" in the main menu:

![Virtual Adapter for MPTS](https://cdn.cesbo.com/help/astra/receiving/ip/mpts-via-udp/virtual-mpts.png)

In the **Address** field set the source UDP, for example `udp://239.255.1.1:1234`. Read more about UDP address format in [Receiving UDP/RTP](./udp).

Apply changes, and then you can scan the adapter to get a list of available channels. Select the channels you want to add and click apply.

## Create channels manually

On any Astra version you may append channels from MPTS stream manually.

First of all analyze UDP MPTS with MPEG-TS Analyzer:

```
astra --analyze udp://239.255.1.1:1234
```

Read more how to analyze streams: [Astra MPEG-TS Analyzer](../../../misc/tools-and-utilities/tv-and-media/astra-mpeg-ts-analyzer). Analyzer shows information about available channels, for example:

```
INFO: PMT pnr:100 version:1
INFO: PMT pnr:200 version:1
```

Next you can create channel by clicking `New Stream` in the main menu. In the channel settings set name and input address with program number (PNR): `udp://239.255.1.1:1234#pnr=100`. And click Apply to save settings.

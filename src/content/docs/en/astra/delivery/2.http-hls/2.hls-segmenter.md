The HLS Segmenter is Astra feature to split continuous media stream into HLS segments. To provide access to HLS segments Astra generates HLS Media Playlist.

Astra specifically functions as the HLS segmenter. Other features such as transcoding and caching require additional software. For instance, FFmpeg is recommended for transcoding, while Nginx could be used for caching.

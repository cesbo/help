Astra installation is a simple process â€“ just copy single binary file to your server.

## Requirements

- Any Linux based operation system
- x86 64bit CPU
- Connection to the internet on your server
- Periodic internet access is required for license validation by Astra on the servers: `ls1.cesbo.com`, `ls2.cesbo.com`, and `ls3.cesbo.com`

:::note
In this guide we use the **curl** command to download files. Most Linux distribution has pre-installed **curl**
:::

## Install Astra

Open your server console and download binary file:

```sh
curl -Lo /usr/bin/astra https://cesbo.com/astra-latest
```

Set execute permission:

```sh
chmod +x /usr/bin/astra
```

Installation completed, now you may check version number:

```sh
astra -v
```

## Get License

Valid license is required to launch Astra on your server. You may get demo license for free or buy subscription on our web site: https://cesbo.com/astra-license

To install license follow the instructions in the email with new license.

## Launch Astra

After installation, register new service in the systemd:

```sh
astra init
```

This command registers Astra as a system service with name `astra` and with management port `8000`. To start service launch command:

```sh
systemctl start astra
```

Read more about service management and launching additional services on your server: [Manage Astra Service](/en/astra/admin-guide/manage-service).

## Enable autorun

Turn autorun on for your service:

```sh
systemctl enable astra
```

Now service `astra` will be started automatically on system startup.

## System Tune

For better performance of your Astra server, tune your system settings. You can use our [Tune script](/en/articles/system/tune/) to automatically configure these settings. This script will adjust network parameters, CPU power modes, and other system configurations to enhance the performance of Astra.

## Login to Web Interface

After installing Astra, you can access its web interface using a web browser - Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. The default port for the web interface is 8000. So interface address will be `http://your-server-address:8000`.
To log in to the web interface, use the default login and password, which are both set to "admin".  It is recommended to change the default password to prevent unauthorized access.

title: Channel has no active inputs
---

The error occurs if the channel does not have any available sources for switching.

In the channel settings (Single program stream), you can specify multiple sources (Input) for reservation. These sources work in a sequential order - if the first source fails, a switch to the second source, and so on. The error occurs if the channel lacks available sources for switching.

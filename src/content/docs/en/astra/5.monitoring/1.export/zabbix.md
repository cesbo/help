1. Go to https://zabbix.com
2. Select Zabbix version
3. Select your OS
4. Follow the installation instructions

You can find detailed information on [Zabbix Manuals](https://www.zabbix.com/manuals)

## Zabbix Agent installation

Install Zabbix Agent on the server with Astra.

1. Go to https://www.zabbix.com/download_agents
2. Select your OS
3. Follow the installation instructions

You can find detailed information on [Zabbix Agent Manuals](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/manual/concepts/agent)

## Zabbix Agent configuration

First of all Zabbix Agent should be configured to allow incoming connections from the Zabbix Server. Open the Agent configuration file located in `/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf` with your favorite editor.

1. Find the `Server=` option and set the IP address or hostname of the server with Zabbix Server;
2. Find the `UnsafeUserParameters=` option or append new and set value to `1`.

Save file.

Zabbix Agent receives all information from Astra with scripts writed on Python. Make sure that on your server installed Python3:

```sh
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

for RPM-based system use `yum` instead of `apt`. Next install necessary library for Python:

```sh
pip3 install requests
```

Download scripts for Zabbix Agent:

```
curl https://cdn.cesbo.com/astra/zabbix/agent.tar.gz | tar -zxC /opt
```

Scripts will be saved to the `/opt/zabbix_agent` directory. Download service configuration file for Zabbix Agent:

```
curl -o /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d/astra.conf https://cdn.cesbo.com/astra/zabbix/astra.conf
```

And finally restart Zabbix Agent:

```
systemctl restart zabbix-agent
```

In Zabbix Web Interface open `Configuration` -> `Templates`, then click the `Import` button in the upper right corner. Click `Browse` and select the downloaded template file, then click `Import` button. After successful import, you will see a green message `Imported successfully`

### Configure Template

In Zabbix Web Interface open `Configuration` -> `Templates`, then select `Astra API monitoring` and open the Macros tab. Fill next values:

- First line, set administrator password to Astra Web Interface
- Second line, set administrator username to Astra Web Interface
- The last line, the port of the Astra web interface. If you have multiple processes, specify all ports separated by commas. For example: `8000,8001,8002`

Click `Update` button to apply changes

### Connect Zabbix to Astra

In Zabbix Web Interface open Configuration -> Hosts, then click `Create host` in the top right corner. Fill following fields:

- `Hostname` - any name of the server where Astra is installed, for example: Astra
- `Groups` - select `Cesbo_templates` or create a new group
- `Interfaces` - click add, select `Agent` and specify the IP address or hostname of the server with Zabbix Agent

Open the Templates tab and in the field `Link new templates` append `Astra API monitoring`. Also if you want to control the general state of the system, append also `Linux by Zabbix agent`.

Save changes. After about 10 minutes, you will see graphs and triggers about the status of channels and adapters

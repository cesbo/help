InfluxDB is an open-source time series database.

## Install

Download latest version from

1. Go to InfluxDB site: https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads/
2. Choose latest version
3. Choose your platform
4. Launch commands from the instruction on the InfluxDB site

Find out more information on official site: https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/

InfluxDB is an open-source time series database.

## InfluxDB Configuration

Open the InfluxDB Admin interface at `http://db-server:8086`.

First, create a new bucket. A bucket serves as storage for all data received from Astra. You can find buckets in the left sidebar under the "Load Data" group. To create a new bucket:

1. Click `Create Bucket`
2. Set the bucket name, for example, `astra`
3. Set data retention: in the `Delete Data` section, select `Older than` and choose 30 days or any other value you prefer.

The next step is to grant Astra access to the bucket. In the left sidebar under the `Load Data` group, open `API Tokens`:

1. Click `Generate API Token` and choose `Custom API Token.`
2. Set the token description as `astra`
3. In the Bucket group, set Read and Write permissions for the `astra` bucket.
4. Click `Generate`

Now, InfluxDB is configured and ready to receive data.

## Astra Configuration

Open Settings -> General in the Astra Web Interface. Set options for InfluxDB configuration:

- `Instance Name` - by the default is `astra` will be used as bucket in the InfluxDB
- `InfluxDB Address` - address of the InfluxDB: `http://db-server:8086`
- `InfluxDB Organization` - your orgranization in the InfluxDB settings
- `InfluxDB Token` - paste your token generated on previous step
- Click "Apply & Restart"

## InfluxDB data structure

### Stream

Measurement: `stream`

Tags:

- `id` - unique stream identifier
- `name` - stream name

Data:

- `active` - `true` if stream is active, or `false` if stream work on demand and inactive
- `onair` - `true` if active input works without errors
- `sessions` - uint, number of sessions
- `bitrate` - uint, stream bitrate in KBit/s
- `sc_error` - uint, percent of scrambled TS-packets
- `cc_error` - uint, CC errors counter
- `pes_error` - uint, percent of invalid PES-packets
- `sync_error` - uint, HTTP/HLS sync errors

### Adapter

Measurement: `adapter`

Tags:

- `id` - unique adapter identifier
- `name` - adapter name

Data:

- `lock` - boolean, `true` if tuner has lock and able to receive data
- `signal` - uint, approximate signal level in percent
- `signal_db` - float, signal level in dBm
- `snr` - uint, approximate signal to noise ratio in percent
- `snr_db` - float, signal to noise ratio in dB
- `ber` - uint, bit errors counter
- `unc` - uint, block errors counter
- `bitrate` - total bitrate in Kbit/s

### System information

Measurement: `sysinfo`

Data:

- `la1` - float, load average for 1 minute
- `la5` - float, load average for 5 minutes
- `la15` - float, load average for 15 minutes
- `threads` - uint, number of the threads
- `sys_cpu` - uint, total CPU usage. Could be up to: 100 multiplied with the core numbers on all CPUs
- `app_cpu` - uint, CPU usage by the process and all threads
- `sys_mem` - uint, total RAM usage
- `app_mem` - uint, RAM usage by the process and all threads
- `app_mem_kb` - uint, RAM usage by the process and all threads in kilobytes
- `sys_uptime` - uint, total system uptime in seconds
- `app_uptime` - uint, process uptime in seconds

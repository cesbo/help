The SDT tab is a window that allows you to configure the Service Description Table, which is responsible for providing information about the services available in the transport stream. This information can include the service name, provider name, service type, and other details. In other words, the SDT tab provides a way to define and manage the services that will be available to viewers

- `Service type`: this parameter specifies the type of service that the user wants to configure, such as digital television, digital radio, or data services
- `Service name`: this parameter refers to the name of the service that is being transmitted over the air. The service name is typically displayed on the user's TV or other receiving device
- `PNR`: this parameter describes the Program number of the selected service
- `Scrambled channel`:  this parameter is a checkbox that indicates whether the selected channel is scrambled or not.

    ```bash [terminal]
    git add profiles/your_file_name
    git commit -m "Added profile: %your_file_name%"
    ```
    Replace "your_file_name" with the name of your file.

1. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** : After pushing your changes, go to your forked repository's page on GitHub. There you should see a "Compare & pull request" button for your new branch. Click on it.

1. **Create a Pull Request** : Review the changes you want to make, ensure everything is correct, and then click on the "Create pull request" button.

1. **Wait for review and merge** : Other contributors to the project may review your Pull Request, leave comments, or request changes. Once your PR is reviewed and approved, one of the project maintainers will merge your branch into the main branch.

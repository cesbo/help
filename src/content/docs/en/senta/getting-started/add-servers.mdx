Starting with the December 16, 2024 version, Senta-Streamer supports a multi-server architecture. This feature allows the main server to manage dependent servers (assigning streams, starting, and stopping them). This enables:

- Scaling Senta-Streamer to handle a larger number of streams
- Building geographically distributed transcoding systems
- Simplifying monitoring and management of multiple Senta-Streamer servers

### Adding an Additional Server to the Main Senta-Streamer Server

**On the remote server:**

<Steps>

1. Install the Senta-Streamer binary.

1. Verify the functionality of the `ffmpeg` utility.

1. Add Senta-Streamer to autostart, similar to the main server setup.

1. Ensure Senta-Streamer is running and ready to work (you can check this via the web interface).

1. Enter the [license](/en/senta/getting-started/add-license) key in the settings.

1. Generate an [API key](/en/senta/getting-started/api) (copy it from *Settings â†’ API Key*).

</Steps>

*Note: You do not need to configure streams and profiles, as this will be handled automatically by the main server.*

**On the main server:**

<Steps>

1. Go to the **Servers** section.

1. Click **Add Server**.

1. In the pop-up window, fill in the following:
   - **Server Name** - Any convenient name for display purposes in the web interface and logs. It does not affect management.
   - **IP** - The IP address (or domain name) of the remote server. The server API must be accessible at this address.
   - **Port** - Matches the web interface port of the remote server.
   - **API Key** - The API key of the remote server.

1. After saving, the server should appear in the server table, showing its status. If the main server successfully connects to it via the API, the status will display as *online*.

</Steps>

### Managing Streams

To assign a stream to a remote server, go to the stream settings on the main server and select the desired server under the **Server** option. Upon saving the stream settings, the stream will automatically start on the remote server.

Similarly, you can switch servers for a stream during operation (for example, when taking a server down for maintenance).

Senta Playlist (SP) is a convenient solution for managing media resources: radio, internet TV, and streams.

SP allows you to organize channels by themes and packages. You can create individual playlists for each user.

## Installation and Setup

<Steps>

1. Go to [senta.tv/bins](https://senta.tv/bins) and download the latest version of Senta Playlist.

1. Unpack the archive and run the program.<br/>
  <Badge text="Windows" variant="note" /> The Windows firewall may ask if you allow Senta Playlist to send and receive data. Click "Allow access" to proceed.<br/>
  💡 During the first launch, the program will perform some preparatory steps, so it might take longer than usual.<br/>

1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

1. [Configure the admin account and enter the license key](#-admin-configuration)

</Steps>

:::tip[Good to know]
To see the available launch parameters, run:
```sh
./senta-playlist --help
```

You can change the Senta Playlist port using the command:
```sh
./senta-playlist --port 3001
```
:::

### 🔑 Admin Configuration

After registering an account, you will be prompted to configure Senta Playlist.

:::caution[Important!]
First, you need to enter the license key in the appropriate field and apply the settings.

Without a license, Senta Playlist **will not function**.
:::

Next, configure the method of delivering channel icons to users. You can use Senta Playlist's resources or distribute original icons through external [CDNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Delivery_Network), such as Imgur.

:::note[Important!]
If you choose to use Senta Playlist as the icon server, specify the address through which your clients can access Senta Playlist. Alternatively, you can set up a [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) to redirect requests to SP. In this case, provide the proxy address.

## Channel Organization

### 📺 Channels

The easiest way to add channels is to upload an [.m3u8 playlist](https://open-file.ru/types/m3u8) downloaded from [Astra Cesbo](https://help.cesbo.com/astra/getting-started).

![Uploading channels process](https://cesbo.b-cdn.net/senta/help/v3/uploading_channels.gif "Uploading channels process")

You can also create a channel manually using a dedicated form.

![Manual channel entry](https://cesbo.b-cdn.net/senta/help/v3/manually_entering_channel.gif "Manual channel entry")

To organize channels, we offer two categories: `groups` and `packages`.

Channels are grouped by themes, and groups are combined into packages. A package is a set of channels provided to viewers (e.g., through a subscription plan).

### 🎨📺 Channel Groups

You can create a new group on the respective screen by clicking the `Add Group` button. Enter the name and select channels for this group. Click `Save`, and the group will be created!

![Creating a group](https://cesbo.b-cdn.net/senta/help/v3/creating_a_group.gif "Creating a group")

💡 A channel can belong to multiple groups.

### 📦📺 Channel Packages

Creating a package is similar to creating a group. On the `Packages` screen, click `Add Package`, enter the name, and select groups for this package. Click `Save`. Done!

💡 A group can belong to multiple packages.

### 🏠📡 Viewers

On the `Users` page, you can create clients and assign them [channel packages](#-channel-packages).

## Middleware for Astra

When configuring [Astra Cesbo](https://help.cesbo.com/astra/getting-started), you can specify Senta Playlist as a [middleware](https://help.cesbo.com/astra/delivery/http-hls-auth/middleware#http-request) for verifying viewers' access to channels:

Service URL for verification:

```
GET %Path from Astra Cesbo to Senta Playlist%/astra/tokens/verifications
```

For example:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/astra/tokens/verifications
```

:::note[Important!]
To configure the path from Astra Cesbo to Senta Playlist, [Astra Cesbo](https://help.cesbo.com/astra/getting-started) must be able to send API requests to Senta Playlist. The requests can be made either via the internet or a local network—what matters is the ability to communicate.
:::

## Moderation and Monitoring

Once you've organized the playlist, you can download it and share it with clients.

During use, [Astra Cesbo](https://help.cesbo.com/astra/delivery/http-hls-auth/middleware#http-request) will verify with Senta Playlist whether the user is allowed to watch the channel. For instance, it will check if the [device limit](#device-limit) for the user is met.

You can view channel-opening statistics on the [corresponding screen](#-user-statistics).

### 📤 Playlist Export

After creating a user and organizing channels, you can download the [playlist file](https://open-file.ru/types/m3u8) to your computer and share it with users.

There are two ways to download the playlist:

1. Click the download button in the user list:
![Downloading playlist from the list](https://cesbo.b-cdn.net/senta/help/v3/download_directly.gif "Downloading playlist from the list")

2. Use the viewer editing screen:
![Downloading playlist via form](https://cesbo.b-cdn.net/senta/help/v3/download_via_form.gif "Downloading playlist via form")

### 📈 User Statistics

As viewers watch channels from the playlist, Senta Playlist collects usage statistics. Based on this data, the number of devices used by a viewer is checked.

#### Device Limit

Viewers' requests to open a channel will be allowed if:

The number of unique IP addresses within 24 hours does not exceed the device limit for that viewer and denied otherwise.
